    <section class="Bio">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a skilled professional with extensive experience in business
        analysis, systems testing, and customer service, backed by an ISTQB
        certification in software testing and an FTI Certificate in Business
        Analysis. Over the past 15 years, I have gained valuable expertise in
        managerial, sales, commerce, and administrative roles within the Life
        Insurance and Investment industry. My career has involved testing
        various applications, analyzing business processes, and providing
        innovative solutions to complex challenges in high-pressure
        environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following my retrenchment 10/31/2024, I have pursued studies in Web
        Development and Software Engineering. This transition will allow me to
        expand my technical skill set and refine my ability to design,build,
        and maintain modern web applications. With a strong background in
        systems testing and business analysis, I am leveraging my experience
        to develop a deeper understanding of software development, ensuring I
        remain adaptable and forward-thinking in the evolving landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion for delivering exceptional customer service has been
        recognized through multiple accolades, including the Old Mutual
        Platinum Award and the Old Mutual Customer Obsession Award in 2021 and
        2022. My ability to communicate effectively, analyze problems, and
        implement strategic solutions has positioned me as a versatile
        professional. As I progress in my web development studies, I am eager
        to contribute my technical expertise and problem-solving skills to
        dynamic projects and innovative teams. In the future I hope to grow as
        a full stack developer and contribute to meaningful projects that
        makes positive impacts.
